Maximizng risk-free bet promotions on Online Sportsbooks

Sportsbook occasionally offer promotions that offer users risk-free bets. A risk-free bet is one that pays out normally if it wins, but rewards you with a free bet equal to the size of your losing bet in the case you lose.

A free bet is one that rewards you with the profit of a bet, but not the principal. Implied by the name, if you lose a free bet, you don't actually lose any money.

While there is a well-defined way to maximize the rewards for the free bet you receive ([Oddsjam](https://oddsjam.com/betting-tools/free-bet-converter)), I was unable to find resources on how to maximize risk-free bets. I will explore one strategy in this notebook that relies on two sportsbook offering risk-free bets, and using them in conjunction to guarantee a profit.
